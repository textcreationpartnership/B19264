            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas His Majesty having commanded His Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Peace of the County of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> to attend him in Counsel, on Friday the 25th day of <hi>February</hi> last, did by himself, and the Lord President, acquaint the said Justices, that he was in a short time to remove his Court to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and did Require and Command them to use their utmost endeavour, with care and industry, to preserve the Peace of this Important County of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> during His Majesties absence. His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty was likewise pleased to declare, That he would keep the Laws himself, and did expect his Subjects should likewise keep them; and in particular, the Statute made in the 13th year of his now Majesties Reign, for the Preservation of His Majesties Sacred Person, (whom God preserve with a long Life) was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the said Justies to be put in due execution. His Majesty farther declaring, it was his firm resolution to stick to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to all honest men, such, as he said, he knew the Justices to be, knowing most of them by face. And the said Justices being Saturday following Assembled in Sessions at <hi>Hicks-hall,</hi> having taken into consideration His Majesties Gracious Speech made unto them, and his Command laid upon them; and being likewise sensible that it is not only their Duty,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:196268:2"/>but their Interest to use all possible ways and means for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Peace of this County; did therefore Order, that the said Justices of the Peace should during His Majesties ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence from <hi>London,</hi> in their several and respective Divisions, keep Petty Sessions one day in every week, <hi>(viz.)</hi> on Tuesday, or any other day they should think fit and convenient. And that the said Justices within their respective Divisions, do from time to time, issue forth their Warrants to the several High Constables within their Divisions, thereby commanding them, That they do with their utmost diligence and endeavour, Apprehend and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure all persons offending against the said Statute, (the said Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being hereby desired to insert into their Warrants so much of the said Statute, as to them shall seem meet.) And the said per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons so offending, before them the said Justices at their next Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Sessions to bring, to the intent they may be proceeded against according to Law and Justice. And the said Justices are hereby likewise desired to Charge and Command the said High Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that they do within their respective Divisions, survey the Watches that are kept by their Petty Constables, in their several Divisions, and Order that the said Watches be kept for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from Nine of the clock at Night, until Six in the Morning, to the intent the Kings Peace may be better secured. And the said Justices are hereby farther desired, that they in their War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants Command the said High Constables to Issue forth their War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants to the Petty Constables within their several Divisions, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Commanding them, that they do for the future take an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in Writing of all the Names of those persons they Summon to be upon the Watch. And that they take particular notice of all and every person, that shall after such Summons given make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, and not appear himself, or send some fit person to Watch in his stead; which said Account, the said Petty Constables are hereby required to present fairly Written, to the Justices which shall Assemble at the said Petty Sessions, to the intent all such persons that shall refuse to Watch, may be proceeded against according to Law. And it is farther Ordered by the said Court, that the said Justices be, and they are hereby desired to put this Order in execution forthwith.</p>
